An index in MongoDB is a special data structure that stores a portion of the data set in an easy-to-traverse form. Indexes are used to efficiently query and retrieve documents from a collection by providing quick access to the data based on the indexed fields.

MongoDB can use multiple indexes to optimize query performance. When a query involves multiple fields, MongoDBâ€™s query optimizer can evaluate multiple indexes to determine the most efficient way to execute the query. Additionally, compound indexes, which index multiple fields within a single index, can be created to further enhance query efficiency.


Aggregation in MongoDB is a powerful feature that enables developers to perform complex data transformations and computations on collections of documents. By utilizing the aggregation framework, users can efficiently group, filter, and manipulate data to generate summarized results.
