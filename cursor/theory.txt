IMPLICIT CURSOR

Definition: An implicit cursor is automatically created by MySQL whenever you execute a SQL statement that returns data (e.g., SELECT).

1. Automatically Manged: MySQL internally manages the cursor, so you don’t have to open, fetch, or close it.

2. No Declaration: You don’t declare implicit cursors explicitly in your code; they’re created by MySQL as needed.
