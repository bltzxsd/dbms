The Declaration section: 
Code block start with a declaration section, in which memory variables, constants & cursors can be declared.

The Begin section: Consist of set of SQL and PL/SQL statements, which describe processes that have to be applied to table data. Actual data manipulation, retrieval, looping and branching constructs are specified in this section.

The Exception section: This section deals with handling errors that arise during execution data manipulation statements, which make up PL/SQL code block. Errors can arise due to syntax, logic and/or validation rule.

The End section: This marks the end of a PL/SQL block.

Broadly, PL/SQL blocks are two types: Anonymous blocks and Named blocks are as follows:

1. Anonymous blocks: In PL/SQL, That’s blocks which is not have header are known as anonymous blocks. These blocks do not form the body of a function or triggers or procedure. Example: Here a code example of find greatest number with Anonymous blocks. 

2. Named blocks: That’s PL/SQL blocks which having header or labels are known as Named blocks. These blocks can either be subprograms like functions, procedures, packages or Triggers. Example: Here a code example of find greatest number with Named blocks means using function.
